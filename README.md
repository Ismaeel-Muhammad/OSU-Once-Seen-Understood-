Simple software tailored to the stock market domain datasets
Main functionalities:
* Filtering the graph output by:
	* The industry
	* Time interval
* Controlling which graph to be plotted
* Filter by an attribute value (the one used is "Volume").

Note: Information visualization course task. (Due to some Version/Metafiles issues it has some bugs, so it is preferable to be used in Dark mode)
